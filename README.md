The AI plays the game multiple times using completely random moves! The average end score per starting position is calculated. The move with the highest score is chosen. By default the AI plays 100 games per move. Increase the run count for a stronger AI.

It's interesting to note that even though the AI is based on random moves, it plays quite well. 

Another interesting property is that the AI has no hard-coded intelligence meaning no knowledge about what makes a good move was programmed into it! It "figures it out" all by itself.
